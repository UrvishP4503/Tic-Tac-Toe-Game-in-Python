# Text-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

This is a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that is played on the command-line interface (CLI). The game is implemented in Python and supports two players. Each player takes turns placing X's and O's on the game board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x

## Usage

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the source code.

2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the tic_tac_toe.py file is located.

3. Run the tic_tac_toe.py file by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

4. The game will start and you will be prompted to enter your moves on the command line. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to play the game.

5. Once the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again.

## Game Rules

* The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

* Player 1 can select O or X and depending on the choice Player 2 will be X or O.

* The player who goes first will be selected randomly.

* Players take turns placing their symbols on empty squares.

* The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

* If all squares are filled and no player has 3 in a row, the game is a draw.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue. If you want to contribute code, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes.

## Future Improvements
The current version of the game has some limitations and can be improved in several ways:

* Implement a more intelligent AI opponent for single player mode.
* Improve the user interface by using a graphical interface instead of the CLI.
* Add support for different board sizes and winning conditions.
